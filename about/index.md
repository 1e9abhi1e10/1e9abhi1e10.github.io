- My name is Abhishek Patidar and I am an avid open source enthusiast and Competitive Programmer currently residing in Indore, India.

- I am thrilled to announce that I have been selected as a participant in Google Summer of Code 2023 under the SymPy organization. This opportunity will allow me to work on a project that involves integrating new features into SymPy, a widely used Python library for symbolic mathematics.

- In addition to my passion for open source development and competitive programming, I also have a strong interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. I have taken online courses and completed projects related to these fields, and I am excited to continue exploring them in the future.

- Along with my technical interests, I am also interested in startups and entrepreneurship. I believe that technology can be used to solve many of the world's problems, and I am inspired by the innovative ways that startups are using technology to make a difference.

- I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow, both personally and professionally. If you would like to connect with me and discuss any of these topics, feel free to reach out to me.
