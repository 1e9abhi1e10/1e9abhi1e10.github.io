- My name is Abhishek Patidar and I am an avid open source enthusiast and Competitive Programmer currently residing in Indore, India.

- I am currently studying Electrical Engineering from the Shri G.S. Institute of Science and Technology.

- I have developed a keen interest in Competitive Programming, a vast domain that requires problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically. As an open-source developer at SymPy and currently interning at GeeksforGeeks, I find myself constantly challenged and excited by the complex problems I encounter.
