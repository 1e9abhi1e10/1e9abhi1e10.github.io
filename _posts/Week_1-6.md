ðŸš€ My GSoC Journey ðŸ“š

It's been an incredible journey so far in my Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 
the project, where I have been working on developing benchmarks and implementing 
pseudo-remainder, pseudo-quotient, pseudo-division, and pseudo-exact quotient 
in Sympy. I wanted to take a moment to share my progress and express my 
gratitude to everyone who has supported me along the way.


In this [Pull Request](https://github.com/sympy/sympy_benchmarks/pull/89),
I had the opportunity to contribute by adding benchmarks, which 
allowed us to evaluate the performance and efficiency of the implemented 
algorithms. This helped us gain insights into their effectiveness and identify 
areas for improvement. It was a fulfilling experience to dive into the world of 
benchmarking and witness the impact it can have on optimizing algorithms.


Furthermore, in this [Pull Request](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/25278),
I added the necessary methods to enable the 
functionality we were aiming for. This involved meticulously writing code and 
addressing code quality issues. Although I made a few silly mistakes along the 
way, I learned valuable lessons in code development and quality assurance. 
These experiences have contributed immensely to my growth as a software 
engineer.

I am incredibly grateful to my mentor [Oscar Benjamin](https://github.com/oscarbenjamin) and
[Kalevi Suominen](https://github.com/jksuom) for their 
guidance, patience, and continuous support throughout this GSoC journey.

Looking ahead, there is still much to be accomplished. Our next milestone is to 
implement the subresultant and its benchmark. This addition will further 
enhance the capabilities of Sympy and open up new possibilities for solving 
mathematical equations efficiently.

Once the subresultant implementation is complete, we will shift our focus 
toward the gcd (greatest common divisor) algorithm and develop benchmarks for 
it. This will enable us to evaluate the performance of the gcd algorithm and 
identify areas for optimization.

I am excited about the upcoming challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. 
This GSoC journey has been an incredible learning experience, allowing me to 
apply my theoretical knowledge to real-world problems and contribute to an 
open-source project. I am grateful for this opportunity, and I look forward to 
completing my project successfully and making a positive impact on the Sympy 
community.


Thank you to the entire Sympy community for their constant support and 
encouragement. Together, we are making mathematics more accessible and powerful 
for everyone.
