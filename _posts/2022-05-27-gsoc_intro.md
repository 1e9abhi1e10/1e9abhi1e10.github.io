I am thrilled to share that my proposal has been chosen among numerous high-quality submissions for Google Summer of Code 2023. The announcement of the results has filled me with immense joy and enthusiasm, and I can hardly contain my excitement to begin working on the project. I am grateful for this incredible opportunity.

The organization that I had applied for is [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html), a Python library which is used by programmers worldwide to solve problems in Symbolic Mathematics and Physics.

Here is my project in brief - 

The project aims to add new algorithms for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of polynomials in the sparse representation in order to improve the speed of many parts of sympy such as matrices, solvers, integration, and simplification functions. Currently, the slow speed of polynomial GCD impacts many operations in SymPy, leading to heavy performance penalties and avoiding the use of domain elements in some algorithms. By improving the speed of polynomial GCD algorithms, many parts of SymPy could become faster, and the use of GCD could become more widespread. This project could significantly enhance the overall performance and usability of SymPy.

This is my project [proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xlf72ABH68kb3BT8MISgH9MNIUej-lGo/view?usp=share_link).

As I embark on this journey, I am excited to share my first post on this blog with you. I look forward to adding more content in the future, documenting my progress and experiences along the way.
